# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
### Overview
Bobby and I received word from our manager that further analysis on retirement statistics and further experience using PostgresSQL is required. Our objective in the analysis of Pewlett-Hackard's employee database is two-fold. First, we determined how many employees are near retirement by position in the company. Secondly, the new mentorship program needs experienced employees, that is those who are willing to step down from their previous position to a part time leadership position. These candidates will be selected from the employees nearing retirement. We organized and analyzed these enormous data sets using PostgresSQL, a relational database manager.

### Results
#### Retiring employees by position in the company
* Approximately 70,000 of the 300,000 employees in this data set are approaching retirement. This means that significant employment turnover is incoming.
* Of these nearly 70,000 employees 50,842 of them are employed as Senior Engineers or Senior Staff. Filling and training all of these positions will almost certainly put strain on the existing recruiters.
* Only two managers are likely to retire in the near future. This is a manageable quantity for the company to process.
* It may prove difficult for the company to find enough experienced engineers in the job market. There are certainly not enough engineers in the company to promote unless the rate of promotion is very high.

#### Employees eligible for the mentorship program
* Approximately 1,500 employees are eligible for the mentorship program.
* If you subtract the 9,285 current engineers from the needed 25,916 senior engineers. Each eligible mentor would need to look after up to 10 apprentices, assuming that they accept the position. This does not even take into account the openinings in other postitions.
* Many of these mentors may not have experience in the new technology that will be expected from the new employees. They will likely be between 30 and 40 years older than some new employees.
* This program will not solve the silver tsunami problem on its own; however, it can contribute to the solution.

#### Analysis
At least 72,458 positions, or 24.25% of all employees ever hired at the compnay, need to be filled in the near future.

There are not enough mentors to teach the upcoming employees, that is if they are working part time as planned. It seems additional measures will need to be taken to fill all positions in a timely manner.
