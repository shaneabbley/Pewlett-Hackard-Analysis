# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
### Overview
Bobby and I received word from our manager that further analysis on retirement statistics and further experience using PostgresSQL. Our objective in the analysis of Pewlett-Hackards employee database is two-fold. First, we determined how many employees are near retirement, specifically in relation to their position in the company. Secondly, the new montorship program needed experienced employees, who are willing to step down from their previous position to a part time leadership position. These candidates were selected from the employees nearing retirement. We organized and analyzed these enormous data sets using PostgresSQL, a relational database manager.

### Results
#### Retiring employees by position in the company
* Approximately 70,000 of the 300,000 employees in this data set are approaching retirement. This means that significant employment turnover is incoming.
* Of these nearly 70,000 employees 50,842 of them are employed as Senior Engineers or Senior Staff. Filling and training all of these positions will almost certainly put strain on the existing recruiters.
* Only two managers are likely to retire in the near future. This is a manageable quantity for the company to process.
* It may prove difficult for the company to find enough experienced engineers in the job market. There are certainly not enough engineers in the company to promote unless the rate of promotion is very high.

#### Analysis
How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?

Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
